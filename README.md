# Hangman_Python
 
## > An individual sets a word or list of words.
## >A player takes an initial guess at a letter that might start or be contained in the word or list of words.
## >If the letter is contained in the word/list of words, the player gains a point and takes another turn guessing a letter.
## >If the letter is not contained in the word, the player losses a try(tries)/point, and a part of the hangman appears.
## >For every wrongly guessed letter, the hangman appears bit by bit until the complete image is drawn.
## >Similarly, for every correctly guessed letter, the letters are placed on the screen until the word is completed and the player wins.
